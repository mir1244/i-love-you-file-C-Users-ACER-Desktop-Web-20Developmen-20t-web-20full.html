        <p>Actually, I was so hurt with your behavior and I wanted to cry.</p>
        <p>When a boy cares for a girl too much, it hurts.</p>
        <p>I love you so much. Please give me time.</p>
        <p>I'm sick again. That night I couldn't sleep at all.</p>
        <p>In the morning, I went to another state at 5:30 AM and came back at 7 PM.</p>
        <p>I was hungry and starving all day.</p>
        <p>That night I finally slept, but in the morning, you said I was busy with someone.</p>
        <p>It made me feel worse, especially with a 6-hour class ahead.</p>
        <p>I really love you so much...</p>
